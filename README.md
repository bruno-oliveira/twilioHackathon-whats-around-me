# twilioHackathon-whats-around-me
A repo containing my project for the twilio dev.to sponsored hackathon

## How to use the app

The app is live and running at: 
https://whats-around-me.herokuapp.com/

In order to use this, the browser you're using and/or your phone's web browser needs to be using HTTPS (or else the location API will not work).

Once you access the URL above, you first need to create an account, by clicking "Register" on the top bar.

**Please do provide an email which you have access to, as well as a valid phone number, containing the prefix of your country, in the format:

`+<prefix><number>`

containing no whitespaces. This is mandatory to fill-in in order to do a successful test of the application.

Once you receive an email, upon clicking it, you should receive a welcome SMS, welcoming you to the app, and you should now be able to generate a list of your nearby restaurants.

When you click the green button, the list is generated, and an SMS will be sent containing information regarding the nearby restaurants, with their opening hours, sorted by distance.

## Suggestions

If you have any tips or improvements, do open a PR and I'll do my best to keep this updated while the hackathon is running.

Positive feedback is also encouraged, so if you like it, if it works well for you, and if you discovered new restaurants, do let me know as well :)
